# Obsidian Checkbox Sound

A really early version, but have a simple sound when you check a checkbox.

## Getting Started

The plugin has been submitted to the community plugin store, but due to a backlog, it might take some time before it becomes available. Meanwhile, you have two ways to install the plugin: manually or via BRAT.

### Option 1: Install via BRAT (Beta Reviewers Auto-update Tool)

BRAT is a tool that allows you to install and manage plugins that are not yet available in the Obsidian community store. To install the plugin via BRAT:

1. Install the BRAT plugin from the community plugin store if you haven't already.
2. Once BRAT is installed, open the settings in Obsidian and navigate to the BRAT settings tab.
3. Under "Add a beta plugin for testing," paste the following repository URL: `https://github.com/marijnbent/obsidian-print`.
4. Click "Add Plugin."
5. The plugin will now appear under your installed plugins. Enable it and start printing!

### Option 2: Manual Installation

You can also install the plugin manually by following these steps:

1. Go to the [latest release](https://github.com/marijnbent/obsidian-print/releases/latest) page and download these three files: `manifest.json`, `styles.css`, and `main.js`.
2. In your Obsidian plugins directory, create a new folder called `obsidian-print`.
3. Move the downloaded files into the `obsidian-print` folder.
4. Thatâ€™s it! Enable the plugin in Obsidian and start printing.
